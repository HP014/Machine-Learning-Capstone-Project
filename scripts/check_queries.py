"""Sanity checks on a week's queries before they are submitted (here: on the ones that were submitted).

For each function, compare the newest query in week N with the data up to week N-1: how close it is to the nearest
sampled point (a distance near 0 means a wasted repeat), how far it is from the previous best, whether every value is
inside [0, 1], and whether it is valid for the portal (the course FAQ gives 0.000000 to 0.999999). I submitted exactly
1.000000 for F5 in Weeks 8 to 13 and 0.000000 for F7 in Week 10, and the portal accepted them (see the README).

Usage: python scripts/check_queries.py [--week N]   (default: the latest week in data/)
