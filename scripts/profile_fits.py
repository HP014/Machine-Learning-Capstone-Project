"""Curve fits along a line, used to place the next probe when the surrogate models were no help.

When a Gaussian Process pointed at a point next to a failed one, I fitted a simple curve through the few points
along the direction I had been stepping, and probed near its peak (a parabola through three points, or a cubic
through four). The numbers below are the weekly results recorded in CHANGELOG.md at the time, so this script does
not read data/. Each section says which week's decision it supported.

Usage: python scripts/profile_fits.py
