"""Model and acquisition settings for each function.

kernel / length_scale / nu: chosen by hand, in order of function number. A smooth RBF kernel for the two 2D
functions, and Matern (which allows a rougher function) for the rest, as the higher-dimensional functions have
sparser data and are less predictable. The length scale is only a starting point, because the fit optimises it.
kappa (UCB) and xi (EI): set by a starting rule based on dimension (kappa 1.5 for 2D, 2.0 for F3 to F5, 2.5 for F6
to F8, xi 0.01), then adjusted by judgement. README.md has the table of values and the reasons, and CHANGELOG.md
has the weekly reasoning. fit_label is the text printed when the Gaussian Process is fitted.
